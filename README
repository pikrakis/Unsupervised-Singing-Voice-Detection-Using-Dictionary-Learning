Implementation of the algorithm in: Aggelos Pikrakis, Yannis Kopsinis, Nadine Kroher, Jose Miguel Diaz-Banez, "Unsupervised Singing Voice Detection Using Dictionary Learning", 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), Budapest, Hungary, 2016.

If the code is useful for you, please cite the above paper.

Note that, the method was developed for audio recordings where the accompaniment of the singing voice exhibits consistent behaviour 
throughout the recording. If you try it on arbitrary instrumentation, it will, most likely return results of low recall and 
high precision. 

To use the package:

a) Install the K-SVD implementation from 
http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/software.html

b) Read the instructions in file mainFunction.m

Best wishes,

Aggelos Pikrakis
